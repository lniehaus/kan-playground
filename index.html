      <h2>Um, What Is a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network?</h2>
      <p>A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is an alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Instead of having fixed weights on edges and learnable activation functions on nodes, KANs have learnable univariate functions on edges and simple summation on nodes. Each edge contains a spline-parameterized function that can learn complex transformations, making KANs potentially more interpretable and parameter-efficient than traditional neural networks. For more details, see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756">original KAN paper</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="l--body">
      <h2>How Do KANs Differ from Regular Neural Networks?</h2>
      <p>Traditional neural networks use linear combinations of inputs (weighted sums) followed by non-linear activation functions. KANs flip this: they apply learnable univariate functions on each edge, then simply sum the results at each node. This design is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem, which states that any multivariate continuous function can be represented as compositions of continuous univariate functions. The univariate functions in KANs are typically implemented as B-splines with learnable control points.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="l--body">
      <h2>This Is Cool, Can I Repurpose It?</h2>
      <p>Please do! We've adapted the original <a href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow Playground</a> to work with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. You're free to use it in any way that follows our <a href="https://github.com/lniehaus/kan-playground/blob/master/LICENSE">Apache License</a>. And if you have any suggestions for additions or changes, please <a href="https://github.com/lniehaus/kan-playground/issues">let us know</a>.</p>
      <p>We've also provided some controls below to enable you tailor the playground to a specific topic or lesson.

      <h2>What Do All the Colors Mean?</h2>
      <p>Orange and blue are used throughout the visualization in slightly different ways, but in general orange shows negative values while blue shows positive values.</p>
      <p>The data points (represented by small circles) are initially colored orange or blue, which correspond to positive one and negative one.</p>
      <p>In the KAN, the lines are colored by the average output values of the learnable functions on each edge. Blue shows positive function outputs, while orange shows negative outputs. The thickness represents the magnitude of the learned function.</p>
      <p>In the output layer, the dots are colored orange or blue depending on their original values. The background color shows what the network is predicting for a particular area. The intensity of the color shows how confident that prediction is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="l--body">
      <h2>What Are the Key Parameters?</h2>
      <p><b>Learning Rate:</b> Controls how fast the network learns during training. Higher values make the network learn faster but may cause instability or overshooting. Lower values provide more stable training but slower convergence. KANs may require different learning rates than traditional MLPs due to their unique spline-based architecture.</p>
      <p><b>Grid Size:</b> Determines the number of control points in each B-spline function on the edges. Higher values (e.g., 15-20) allow the splines to learn more complex, detailed functions but increase computational cost and memory usage. Lower values (e.g., 3-5) create simpler, smoother functions that may be less prone to overfitting but might lack the capacity to capture complex patterns.</p>
      <p><b>Spline Degree:</b> Sets the polynomial degree of the B-spline basis functions. Linear (degree 1) creates piecewise linear functions, while higher degrees create smoother curves. Cubic splines (degree 3) are commonly used as they provide a good balance between smoothness and computational efficiency. Higher degrees can capture more complex patterns but may be more prone to overfitting.</p>
      <p><b>Init Noise:</b> Controls the initial random values added to the spline coefficients at network initialization. Zero initialization starts with flat functions, while small noise (0.1-0.3) provides gentle random starting points. Larger noise values (0.8-1.0) create more varied initial functions, which can help break symmetry but may make training less stable.</p>     
      <p><b>Problem Type:</b> Determines the network's output configuration and loss function. Classification problems use categorical outputs with cross-entropy loss for predicting discrete classes (e.g., orange vs. blue points). Regression problems use continuous outputs with mean squared error loss for predicting continuous values (e.g., temperature, price).</p>

        This KAN playground is adapted from the original <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/playground">TensorFlow Playground Repository</a> created by Daniel Smilkov and Shan Carter.
        The KAN implementation is based on the paper "KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks" and uses B-spline interpolation for the learnable univariate functions.
        Many thanks to the original authors and the KAN research community for their foundational work.
